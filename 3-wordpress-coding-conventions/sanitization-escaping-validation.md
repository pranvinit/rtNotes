### Sanitization, Escaping, and Validation

Data should be validated on input and sanitized/escaped on output. This is to ensure that the data is safe to use and display.

#### Sanitization

Sanitization is the process of cleaning up data to make it safe for use. It involves removing unwanted characters, escaping special characters, and filtering input data.

**Common Sanitization Functions in WordPress**:

1. **sanitize_text_field()**: Strips out all characters that are not allowed in a text field.
**Note**: This function removes all invalid utf8 characters, tags, line breaks, percent encoded characters, etc.

2. **sanitize_textarea_field()**: Strips out all characters that are not allowed in a textarea field.

3. **sanitize_email()**: Strips out all characters that are not allowed in an email address.

4. **sanitize_file_name()**: Strips out all characters that are not allowed in a file name.
**Note**: This function replaces whitespace with dashes, removes special characters, and trims the filename.

5. **sanitize_key()**: Strips out all characters that are not allowed in a key name.
**Note**: A valid key has lowercase alphanumeric characters with dashes, or underscores.

6. **wp_kses()**: Filters text based on allowed HTML elements and attributes.
**Note**: This function takes an array of allowed HTML elements and attributes and filters the content based on these rules.

7. **wp_kses_post()**: Filters text based on allowed HTML elements and attributes for post content.
**Note**: This function is similar to `wp_kses()` but is specifically designed for post content.

8. **sanitize_url()**: Sanitizes URLs for use in HTML attributes.

#### Escaping

Escaping is the process of securing output data to prevent XSS attacks. It involves converting special characters to their HTML entities.

**Common Escaping Functions in WordPress**:

1. **esc_html()**: Escapes HTML tags.

2. **esc_attr()**: Escapes HTML attributes.

3. **esc_url()**: Escapes URLs.

4. **esc_textarea()**: Escapes text for use in a textarea.

5. **esc_sql()**: Escapes SQL queries.

#### Validation

Validation is the process of ensuring that data meets certain criteria or constraints. If the data does not meet the criteria, it should be rejected.

**Common Validation Functions in WordPress**:

1. **is_email()**: Checks if the given string is a valid email address.

2. **is_numeric()**: Checks if the given string is numeric.

3. **is_url()**: Checks if the given string is a valid URL.

4. **is_array()**: Checks if a variable is an array.

5. **is_user_logged_in()**: Checks if the current user is logged in.

6. **username_exists()**: Checks if a username exists in the database.

7. **preg_match(), strpos(), strlen()**: PHP functions for pattern matching, string position, and string length validation.

#### Localization & Internationalization

WordPress provides functions for localization and internationalization to make themes and plugins translatable.

**Common Localization Functions in WordPress

1. **__()**: Translates and localizes a string.

2. **_e()**: Echoes a translated string

3. **_x()**: Translates and localizes a string with context.

4. **_n()**: Translates and localizes a string with plural forms.
**Example**:
```php
// If count is <=1, output 'singular', otherwise output 'plural'
echo _n( 'singular', 'plural', $count, 'text-domain' );
```
